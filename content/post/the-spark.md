I, usually, consider myself as a person who can achieve things that he dreams of. 

I mean if we remove all the negative banter in our head, what can we not achieve? I once saw a group of people talk about something that they cannot achieve as something which cannot BE achieved. This was a total bummer for me, because I had achieved that thing and I knew it was possible. The biggest thing was that the person saying these things was an elderly person I respected. Hearing such words from him, made be believe even more in my opinion that anything can be achieved. 

But if anything can be achieved, what keeps stopping us? Whoa, let's not go under that road because there are multiple answers to that question.

But, when in pursuit of achieving things, we see failures. There are times when we see failures which we know we could have easily avoided if we would have "given our best". 

If we would have given our best? Then why the fuck did you not give your best in the first place, you stupid moron? What is wrong with you? You have the skillset, and you have the experience. What is stopping you from acting, you dumb shit?

Ohh btw that's the negative banter in your head that makes you question yourself and your ability to achieve anything and that's when you start going down the rabbithole of, "You are not good enough. It's not your cup of tea."

But, seriously though, why did we not act on it if we were totally qualified to?

After a lot of digging, I finally have my answer. 

* **Lack of Inspiration**
* **Negative banter** 

### Lack of Inspiration

Don't confuse it with lack of motivation because lack of motivation is sometimes a by-product of lack of inspiration. Once you are inspired, you get your motivation back. You start acting on it. You start gaining confidence. People start saying, "Yeah, he still got it!"

There can be mutliple reasons to lose inpiration. I will not get into those, but I do know how to get it back and what is that feeling that you get when you get inspired. 

When you are inspired, you always start looking forward to something. You start forming a vision. You start visualizing your vision (basically day-dreaming). That is how you know you are inspired. 

Kunal Shah, founder of CRED and Freecharge, keeps saying repeatedly that you should follow your *general curiosity*. If you keep following your general curiosity, you are never short of inspiration. If you are curious about how does a car engine works, then fuck it! Go ahead and dig deep into what a car engine looks like. Start learning about how it works. You found more things that you don't know about in the process, go ahead, understand them. In no time, you start building an aptitude for that engines and maybe you land yourself an opportunity to cash from your curiosity. 

Another thing Kunal says is to keep surrouding yourself with people who are smarter than you and are curiosity about some similar things as you are.

### Negative banter

You are short of inspiration. You end up not acting. You don't see results. You start questioning your capabilities. You start doubting yourself. 

That is why, focus on getting back the inspiration. That will, at least, get you to act on things. Now when you are executing, you will see failures and you will start to go through this negative banter. In this moment, leave everything and start visualizing your vision and dreams with two goals,

* You try to imagine what will happen. What will the future look like?
* You tell yourself why you are so sure that this will be the future. (No matter what, you HAVE to think of something that validates your vision. You have to. It's not that difficult.)

Visualization is a powerful tool. Meditation and then visualization is a powerhouse to manifesting your dreams into reality.
